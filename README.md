## Cold and marine colors-oriented theme

 - The goal is to highlight items you'd want to focus on and fade those you
don't need mostly, based on my own experience and feedback of some
alpha-testers(six and a half).

 - Theme is planned to be regularly updated until is optimized for dealing
with ~~EVERY LANGUAGE~~ most popular languages. Once it is, the
project will be over.
